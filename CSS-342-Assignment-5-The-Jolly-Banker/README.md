# Project Description
Assignment 5 - The Jolly Banker was an individual project created for CSS 342. The Jolly Banker was the final project for the course and required the use of
object oriented programming techniques as well as knowledge build through the entirety of the course to be sucessfully completed.

For the Jolly Banker project, I designed and implemented a set of classes that are necessary to perform basic banking transactions. This project provided the 
opportunity for further program/class design as the project requirements did not specifically delineate class stucture or design.

**Project Overview**\
The Jolly Banker is a banking application which processes transactions. The application consists of three phases.

1) The program will read in a string of transactions from a file into an in-memory queue. These transactions can open accounts, withdraw funds, deposit funds, transfer funds, or ask for the transactional history to be printed.
2) The program will next read from the queue and process the transactions in order.
3) When the queue has been depleted the program will print out all open accounts and balances in those accounts.
