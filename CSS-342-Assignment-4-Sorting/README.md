# Project Description
Assignment 4 - Sorting was an individual project created for CSS 342.

For the Sorting project, the purpose of the project was to provide hands-on experience for utilizing various sorting algorithms and to viscerally demonstrate the cost
of O(n^2) vs. O(nlogn) algorithms. The program also clearly shows that algorithms with the same complexity may have different running times.

**Problem**

Write a program which implements the following sorts and compares the performance for operations on arrays of integers of growing sizes 10, 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, 
etc....  Then graph the performance of the different sorts as a function of the size of the array.

1)BubbleSort\
2)InsertionSort\
3)MergeSort\
4)Non-Recursive, one extra array MergeSort (Weâ€™ll call this improved version, IterativeMergeSort from here on out in this homework)\
5)QuickSort\
6)ShellSort


# Major Deliverables

-- SortImpls.h file which has implementations of all of the sorts\
-- A separate report in word or pdf which includes:  Graphs that compares the performance among the different sorting algorithms with increasing data size.
